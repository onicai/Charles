# ctrlb_canister (Control & Load Balancer)

### Setup

Install mops (https://mops.one/docs/install)
Install motoko dependencies:

```bash
# from folder backend/ctrlb_canister:

mops install
```

### Deploy

We assume you already have the `backend/llm_0/1/2/3` deployed, and the ctrlb_canister whitelisted.

Then you deploy the ctrlb_canister with:

```bash
# from folder backend/ctrlb_canister:

# Activate the same python environment as you defined for deploying the LLMs
# (This might not be needed, but I did it this way...)
conda activate icpp_llm

# Deploy, initialize and test it
# WARNING: This will re-deploy the ctrlb_canister with loss of all existing data!
scripts/deploy.sh --network [local/ic]
```

### Test with dfx

```bash
dfx canister call ctrlb_canister whoami

# Run with same identity used to deploy (as a controller)
$ dfx canister call ctrlb_canister amiController
(variant { Ok = record { status_code = 200 : nat16 } })

# This call checks if the ctrlb_canister is whitelisted in the llm_0
$ dfx canister call ctrlb_canister isWhitelistLogicOk
(variant { Ok = record { status_code = 200 : nat16 } })

# Call the Inference endpoint
$ dfx canister call ctrlb_canister Inference '(record {prompt="Joe went swimming in the pool"; steps=30; temperature=0.1; topp=0.9; rng_seed=0})'
(
  variant {
    Ok = record {
